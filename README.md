## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable, creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects.  

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough documentation library of any modern web application framework. The [Laravel documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/5.4) is thorough, complete, and makes it a breeze to get started learning the framework.
