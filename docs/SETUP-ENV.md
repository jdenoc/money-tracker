## Environment variable setup

Be sure to edit the `.env` file generated during setup. A few of the default values should be fine to use. Modify those as needed.  
That being said, there are certainly variables that should be modified at this point. They are:
- `APP_ENV`
- `APP_DEBUG`
- `APP_NAME`
- `APP_VERSION` (can be set by `php artisan app:version`)
- `APP_URL`
- `DB_HOST`
- `DB_DATABASE`
- `DB_USERNAME`
- `DB_PASSWORD`
- `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL`
